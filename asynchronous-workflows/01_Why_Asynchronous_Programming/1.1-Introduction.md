# 1.1 Introduction

## Course Overview

This course will guide you through building **lightning-fast, efficient applications** that overcome traditional performance bottlenecks through asynchronous workflows.

### Course Plan

1. **Understanding Asynchronous Programming**
   - Rationale for using asynchronous programming
   - Scenarios where it provides the most benefit

2. **Implementing Asynchronous HTTP Calls**
   - Using the `AioHTTP` Python library
   - Replacing synchronous HTTP operations

3. **Designing Efficient Workflows with AsyncIO**
   - Maximizing library capabilities
   - Building optimal async patterns

4. **Integrating AsyncIO and AioHTTP**
   - Creating high-performance, scalable systems
   - Real-world implementation strategies

## The Performance Challenge

### Globomantics Case Study

**The Problem**: Despite Python's rich ecosystem and high productivity, performance concerns were growing. A critical application demonstrated unsatisfactory performance, and even deploying it on more powerful hardware yielded **negligible improvement**.

**Root Cause Analysis** revealed:
- Significant time spent waiting for API call results
- Delays from multiple database queries
- I/O-bound operations create bottlenecks

> **Analogy**: "It's like being stuck in a traffic jam. Sitting and waiting in a muscle car is the same as sitting and waiting in a regular car."

## Code Execution Models

| **Execution Model** | **How It Works** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** | **Best For** |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Synchronous** | Single thread executing operations sequentially (print → increment → etc.) | Intuitive and easy to understand | Inefficient for I/O-bound operations (APIs, databases, file reading). Application sits and waits for each operation to complete | Simple, linear workflows |
| **Multi-threading** | Multiple threads running in parallel. One thread calls API while another queries database simultaneously | Can handle concurrent operations. Python 3.13: Experimental support for running threads on different CPU cores | Thread synchronization issues, potential deadlocks, complexity risks | CPU-bound operations (when properly implemented) |
| **Asynchronous** | Multiple operations run concurrently on a single thread | Reduces synchronization risks. Excels at I/O-bound operations with significant waiting time | Learning curve, requires async-compatible libraries | I/O-bound operations. Future: Better CPU-bound performance in upcoming Python versions |

## Why Asynchronous Programming Increases Performance

### Core Benefits

1. **Concurrent Operation Handling**
   - Processes multiple operations simultaneously instead of sequentially
   - Dramatically increases throughput

2. **Eliminates Unnecessary Waiting**
   - Example: Instead of making 5 API calls sequentially, send all requests simultaneously
   - Reduces total waiting time drastically

3. **Maximizes CPU Usage**
   - Main thread spends less time waiting for I/O operations
   - Better resource utilization

### Perfect Fit for the Problem Use Case

Asynchronous programming directly addresses challenges:
- **I/O-bound bottlenecks**: API calls and database queries
- **Performance optimization**: Without hardware upgrades
- **Scalability**: Handle more concurrent operations

## Key Takeaway

> **Asynchronous programming increases performance for applications with I/O-bound operations** by enabling concurrent execution and eliminating wait times.

This makes `AsyncIO` and its ecosystem the most promising solution for applications facing similar performance challenges as Globomantics.
