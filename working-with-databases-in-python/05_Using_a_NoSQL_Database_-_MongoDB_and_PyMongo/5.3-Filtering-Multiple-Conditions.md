# Review of Filter Documents

- The ```$inc``` operator is used to the ```update_one``` method to increase a value selected by the filter document.
- Mongita will not allow filter documents with multiple conditions.

```python
investments.update_one({
	"coin": "bitcoin"
}, {
	"$inc", {"amount": 1}
})
```

- The ```$and``` operator will apply multiple filter documents.
- The ```$and``` operator accepts an array of filter documents and applied them all.
	- In Python we represent this as a ```List[dict]```.

```python
{"$and": [
	{"coin": "bitcoin"},
	{"amount": {"$gt": 2}}
]}
```

- Mongita violates the *Zen of Python*, as it will return an empty document instead of an error, if we use multiple filtering.
