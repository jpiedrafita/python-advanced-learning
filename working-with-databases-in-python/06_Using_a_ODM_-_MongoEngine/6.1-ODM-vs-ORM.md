- **ORM (Object Relational Mapper)**: Create associations between Python objects and tables in a relational database.
	- Reduce or eliminate SQL code in the app.
- **ODM (Object Document Mapper)**: Create associations between Python objects and documents in NoSQL databases.


# MongoEngine

- NoSQL don't follow a single pattern like SQL databases (2-dimensional tables).
	- MongoEngine works only with MongoDB, it will not work with other document databases or NoSQL database engines.
- MongoEngine lets to avoid JSON, like SQLAlchemy lets to avoid SQL code.
- MongoEngine lets to avoid lists and dictionaries, like SQLAlchemy lets to avoid lists of tuples.
- MongoEngine API is similar to the Django ORM, but not a replacement.
	- MongoEngine used to support Django.
- MongoEngine does not add anything to the MongoDB database.
	- It may appear that the model classes in MongoDB are enforcing a schema on the database, but they are not. This is merely syntactic sugar that makes the code easier to work with.
