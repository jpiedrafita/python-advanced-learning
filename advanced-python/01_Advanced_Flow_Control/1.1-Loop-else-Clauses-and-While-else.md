# 1.1 Loop-else Clauses and While-else

## Key Idea

- `else` can be attached to loops (`while`, `for`), not just `if`.
- Executes only when the loop condition becomes **false**.
- Skipped if the loop exits with `break`.
- Rare feature, Guido van Rossum said he wouldn’t include it again.

## **Behavior**

- In an if-else:
    - if branch executes if condition is **truthy**.
    - else branch executes if condition is **falsy**.    
- In a while-else:
    - The else branch executes **only when the loop condition becomes false**.  
    - If a break statement is used to exit the loop, the else block is skipped.
    
```python
n = 0
while n < 3:
    print("n is", n)
    n += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished because condition is false")
````

- Here the loop exits when the condition n < 3 becomes false, so the else executes.

Output:
```bash
n is 0
n is 1
n is 2
Loop finished because the condition is false
```

```python
n = 0
while n < 3:
    print("n is", n)
    if n == 1:
        break
    n += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished without break")
```

Output:
```bash
n is 0
n is 1
```

- **Why not just put code after the loop?**
	- If no break is used, writing code after the loop is equivalent.
	- But when break exists, placing code after the loop may lead to **duplicating the loop condition** (violating DRY principle).

**Bad duplication**:
```python
n = 0
while n < 3:
    if some_condition(n):
        break
    n += 1

# Have to repeat the condition check again
if n >= 3:
    print("Loop finished naturally")
```

**Cleaner with while-else**:
```python
n = 0
while n < 3:
    if some_condition(n):
        break
    n += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished naturally")
```

## **Best Practice**

- The keyword else here is misleading — it would be clearer if Python had used nobreak.
- If you use this construct, **document it with a comment**, e.g.:

```python
while condition:
    if something:
        break
else:  # nobreak
    print("Loop ended normally")
```
